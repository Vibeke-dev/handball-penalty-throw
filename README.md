# Handball Penalty Throw
This is a game where you get to be the super cool handball goalkeeper of Denmark, Landin. Your goal is to keep the goal empty when the ball is thrown. 
The game is created during the EM 2022 in January. <br /> <br />
Game is made as part of my bootcamp at Ironhack where the first two week has been focusing on HTML, CSS and JavaScript, 
where third week has been to use that knowledge in creating a game.
